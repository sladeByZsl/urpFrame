# 2022年12月07日15:34:04 Treat everything not text if not specified
# Avoid crlf messing up things like .asset and ProjectSettings (But we'd like to diff so we do not assign binary[-text -diff] tag)
# You should never do line ending conversion on .asset, .asset could be CRLF(ProjectSettings) LF(Tile set config) or binary even if forced text(Lighting and Terrain Data)
* -text

# Unity visible meta is LF regardless of created platform
*.meta text eol=lf

# All extensions are specified in lower cases
# [git config core.ignorecase true] is assumed.
# The projects are going to be developed across OSX and Windows, if we allow OSX user to commit file names only differ in capitalization.
# These files will prevent Windows users to pull


# Human authored code
# Files with auto crlf conversion, auto crlf is painful to get right
# But we need it to avoid committing files with all line endings changed by text editor
# Such commit will cripple [git blame]
# We decided to force lf across platforms now for adding code as source hash calculation input
# And we'd like source code having the same binary across Windows and macOS so that the souce hash would be calculated the same
